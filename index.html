<P><FONT size=+2><B> Ramsey Theory on Infinite Structures. </B></FONT>

  One of my current research interests is mapping  out those infinite structures which have analogues of the infinite Ramsey theorem.  This is the area of "big Ramsey degrees" and "infinite dimensional Ramsey theory."  This area has its beginnings in Sierpinski's example of a coloring of (unordered) pairs of rationals into two colors so that any subset forming a dense linear order without endpoints (i.e. an isomorphic subcopy the rationals) still has pairs with both colors. An article on <A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00655.pdf">Ramsey theory of homogeneous structures: current trends and open problems</A> will appear in the 2022 ICM Proceedings.  This article gives a gentle introduction to the subject and an overview of current research in the area. 

<P>
  An expository article  on the <A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05985.pdf">method of strong coding trees</A>, which I  developed to prove that the <A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00220.pdf">triangle-free Henson graph has finite big Ramsey degrees</A> and extended to prove that <A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06660.pdf">all Henson graphs have finite big Ramsey degrees</A>, appeared in  "Contemporary Logic and Computing," in 2020.
This method has proved to be a key in unlocking big Ramsey degrees of various binary relational structures as well as proving indivisbility for higher arities with certain strong amalgamation properties. 
 With Gasarch, we wrote an open problems article geared towards undergraduates, appearing in ACM SIGACT News 51 (2020), no. 4, 30--46. 


<P><B> In the summer of 2020, I finished a proof characterizing <A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01985.pdf"> the exact big Ramsey degrees of the triangle-free Henson graph</A>.</B>  This was proved via a minor modification in the triangle-free coding trees developed <A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00220.pdf">here</A>. 
  The same result was around the same time  independently obtained by Balko, Chodounsky, Hubicka, Konecny, Vena, and Zucker.  Our joint  paper characterizing <B> exact big Ramsey degrees  of all free amalgamation classes of structures with finitely many binary (and unary) relations  with  finitely many irreducible forbidden substructures </B> is available <A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08409.pdf">here</A>.
This work builds on   <A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13162.pdf">Zucker's  upper bounds</A> as well as new combinatorial methods for upper bounds developed by Hubicka using <A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00967.pdf">parameter spaces</A>.
</P>

With Coulson and Patel, we  formulated  a property (SDAP^+) strengthening the Disjoint Amalgamation Property and proved that
<A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02034.pdf">any Fraisse class with finitely many  relations of arity at most two satisfying SDAP^+ admits a
  big Ramsey structure, which moreover is simply characterized by two additional relations</A>.  The second main result in that paper is that if a Fraisse structure  with finitely many relations of any arity satisfies SDAP^+, then it  is indivisible. (See Zucker's <A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02702.pdf">Big Ramsey degrees and topological dynamics</A> for the definition of "big Ramsey structure".)  This work characterizes exact big Ramsey degrees for many  new Fraisse classes, while streamlining several previous results.
Key features of the work include development of 
coding trees of 1-types to prove Ramsey theorems directly on the structures,
and the first "envelope-free" proofs.</P>





Extending the infinite dimensional Ramsey theory of the natural numbers (Galvin-Prikry and Ellentuck Theorems) to infinite structures is in its nascent stages.  A paper to appear in the proceedings of the 2016 Czech DocCourse on Ramsey Theory proved an analogue of the Galvin-Prikry theorem for  the Rado graph in      <A href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.00266.pdf">Borel sets of Rado graphs and Ramsey's Theorem</A>.  I have recently finished typing the proof extending this  to <A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00169.pdf">structures with SDAP^+ and relations of arity at most two</A>.</P>         


Working with Kaiuyn Wang, we have extended results of Huber-Geschke-Kojman and of Zhang on big Ramsey degrees of the profinite graph to  more general binary relational structures.  We characterize the exact big Ramsey degrees for ordered graphs, ordered k-clique-free graphs, ordered oriented graphs, and ordered tournaments inside their  inverse limits.
<A href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.08736.pdf">Inverse limit structures</A>


<P>  Computability and reverse mathmatical aspects of the Halpern-Lauchli and Milliken theorems and big Ramsey structures of the rationals and the Rado graph have been analysed by Angles d'Auriac, Cholak, Dzhafarov, Monin, and Patey in <A href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.09739.pdf">this treatise</A>.

BLAST is an interdisciplinary conference focused on  Boolean algebras, Logic, Lattices, algebraic Logic, universal Algebra, Set theory, and Topology (Set-theoretic, point free, and general).  These are  logic-related areas of interest to researchers at Chapman University; New Mexico State University, Las Cruces;  University of Colorado, Boulder;  University of Denver;  University of Kansas, Lawrence; University of Missouri, Kansas City; University of Nebraska, Omaha;  University of North Texas, and others.  BLAST conferences are good for graduate students, early career mathematicians, and anyone interested in expanding their research to include neighboring areas.  We are grateful for  National Science Foundation funding for the BLAST Conference Series.
