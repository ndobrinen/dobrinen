<P><FONT size=+2><B> Ramsey Theory on Infinite Structures. </B></FONT>

  One of my current research interests is infinite structures which have analogues of the infinite Ramsey theorem.  This is the area of "big Ramsey degrees" and "infinite-dimensional Ramsey theory."  My article  <A href="https://ems.press/books/standalone/275/5435">Ramsey theory of homogeneous structures: current trends and open problems</A>  gives an introduction to and overview of this area. 
	
<P>
  An expository article  on the <A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05985.pdf">method of strong coding trees</A>, which I  developed to prove that the <A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00220.pdf">triangle-free Henson graph has finite big Ramsey degrees</A> and extended to prove that <A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06660.pdf">all Henson graphs have finite big Ramsey degrees</A>, appeared in  "Contemporary Logic and Computing," in 2020.
This method has proved to be a key in unlocking big Ramsey degrees of various binary relational structures as well as proving indivisbility for higher arities with certain strong amalgamation properties. 
 With Gasarch, we wrote an open problems article geared towards undergraduates, appearing in ACM SIGACT News 51 (2020), no. 4, 30--46. 


<P><B> In the summer of 2020, I finished a proof characterizing <A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01985.pdf"> the exact big Ramsey degrees of the triangle-free Henson graph</A>.</B>  This was proved via a minor modification in the triangle-free coding trees developed <A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00220.pdf">here</A>. 
  The same result was around the same time  independently obtained by Balko, Chodounsky, Hubicka, Konecny, Vena, and Zucker.  Our joint  paper characterizing <B> exact big Ramsey degrees  of all free amalgamation classes of structures with finitely many binary (and unary) relations  with  finitely many irreducible forbidden substructures </B> is available <A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08409.pdf">here</A>.
This work builds on   <A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13162.pdf">Zucker's  upper bounds</A> as well as new combinatorial methods for upper bounds developed by Hubicka using <A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00967.pdf">parameter spaces</A>.
</P>

With Coulson and Patel, we  formulated  a property (SDAP^+) strengthening the Disjoint Amalgamation Property and proved that
<A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02034.pdf">any Fraisse class with finitely many  relations of arity at most two satisfying SDAP^+ admits a
  big Ramsey structure, which moreover is simply characterized by two additional relations</A>.  The second main result in that paper is that if a Fraisse structure  with finitely many relations of any arity satisfies SDAP^+, then it  is indivisible. (See Zucker's <A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02702.pdf">Big Ramsey degrees and topological dynamics</A> for the definition of "big Ramsey structure".)  This work characterizes exact big Ramsey degrees for many  new Fraisse classes, while streamlining several previous results.
Key features of the work include development of 
coding trees of 1-types to prove Ramsey theorems directly on the structures,
and the first "envelope-free" proofs.</P>


Extending the infinite dimensional Ramsey theory of the natural numbers (Galvin-Prikry and Ellentuck Theorems) to infinite structures is in its nascent stages.  A paper to appear in the proceedings of the 2016 Czech DocCourse on Ramsey Theory proved an analogue of the Galvin-Prikry theorem for  the Rado graph in      <A href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.00266.pdf">Borel sets of Rado graphs and Ramsey's Theorem</A>.  In 2022, I finished typing the proof extending this  to <A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00169.pdf">structures with SDAP^+ and relations of arity at most two</A>.
In 2023, Andy Zucker and I have developed the 
	  <A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06872.pdf"> infinite-dimensional Ramsey theory of binary free amalgamation classes</A>, culminating much work in this area while showing that a weaker version of Todorcevic's Axiom A.3(2) suffices, along with his other axioms, to guarantee Ramsey spaces.
  </P>         

<P>  Computability and reverse mathmatical aspects of the Halpern-Lauchli and Milliken theorems and big Ramsey structures of the rationals and the Rado graph have been analysed by Angles d'Auriac, Cholak, Dzhafarov, Monin, and Patey in <A href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.09739.pdf">this treatise</A>.   With Cholak and McCoy, last summer we showed that the statement, "All finite triangle-free graphs have finite big Ramsey degrees in the Henson graph" has at least the strength of ACA_0 over RCA_0.  This result and related ones are being written up.

  Professor Nikolaos Galatos and myself  co-founded the <A href="http://math.colorado.edu/blast/">BLAST Conference Series</A> when we
	co-chaired BLAST 08 at the University of Denver. We also co-organized BLAST 2018 at the University of Denver.  BLAST is an interdisciplinary conference focused on  Boolean algebras, Logic, Lattices, algebraic Logic, universal Algebra, Set theory, and Topology (Set-theoretic, point free, and general).  These are  logic-related areas of interest to researchers at Chapman University; New Mexico State University, Las Cruces;  University of Colorado, Boulder;  University of Denver;  University of Kansas, Lawrence; University of Missouri, Kansas City; University of Nebraska, Omaha;  University of North Texas, and others.  BLAST conferences are good for graduate students, early career mathematicians, and anyone interested in expanding their research to include neighboring areas.  We are grateful for  National Science Foundation funding for the BLAST Conference Series.

Notre Dame Céilí Band. </B>  </FONT>

	<P>  For the past several years, Notre Dame has held several  <A href="https://irishlanguage.nd.edu/undergraduate-programs/ceili-band/">Ceilis</A> each year.   The band and dancers consist of  undergraduate and graduate students, staff and faculty, and community members.  We play Fall, Halloween, Christmas, Valentine's, and Spring Ceilis free for all Notre Dame and broader community members.   Here is an   <A href="https://irishrover.net/2023/10/whos-who-the-notre-dame-ceili-band/">article</A>  about the Ceili Band from  our university newspaper, The Irish Rover. Unfortunately, the classes are not being offered this year, but there should still be some events on campus and in South Bend.
